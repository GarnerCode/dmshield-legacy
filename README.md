# DM Shield Legacy

## Dungeons & Dragons Campaign Management System

DM Shield is a web-only tool for dungeon masters to store information regarding their campaign. 
A new cross-platform version is being developed for web, iOS and Android.

## Technologies Utilized

**React**: DM Shield is built upon the React library, allowing seamless UI updates, as well as faster
and easier development of new features.

**Redux**: Centralizing the application's state using Redux ensures states remain consistent throughout
DM Shield, as well as allows for much easier sharing of states and properties between components.

**React Router**: Utilizing React Router allows for instant navigation between main components without
requiring reloads, further improving user experience and reducing the amount of code needed.
